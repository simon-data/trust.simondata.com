### Essential Cookies
These are cookies that are required to provide you with features or services that you have requested. For example, Cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our site. Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Services’ performance and may make certain features and services unavailable.

### Functionality Cookies
These Cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Services. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).

### Analytical Cookies
These Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our site. This includes information about the number of visitors to the site, what pages visitors view on our site and how long visitors are viewing pages on the site. Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our advertising campaigns and to optimize our Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising.

### Third Party Cookies
These are Cookies placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to those third parties about browsing habits (including your visits to our Services, the pages you have visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked) that may help identify if certain services that such third parties provide are being used, identify your interests, retarget you and serve advertisements that are relevant to you. We do not have control or access to such Cookies. If you look at one page on our Services, an advertisement may be delivered to you on our Services or on other sites, for products referenced on that page or for similar products and services. We do not engage in retargeted advertising for children users of our Services.

In this Privacy Notice we display the advertising providers we currently engage as well as a link to enable you to opt-out from the processing of your personal information. Opt-out options are also available on the websites of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the European Digital Advertising Alliance (eDAA).

### Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies
The types of Cookies described above may be "session Cookies" which are temporary Cookies that are only stored on your device while you are visiting our site or "persistent Cookies" which are Cookies that are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our site. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cook-ie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary over time, and measure the ef-fectiveness of advertising efforts. Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience.

Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave the Services.

## Protection and Storage
Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, the use of third-party service providers. We, and third-party service providers on our behalf, store and process your personal information in the United States and elsewhere in the world. If your information is transferred to other countries, including countries which may not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in your country, we will protect the information as described in this Privacy Notice.

The servers on which personal information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access. While we take reasonable efforts to guard personal information we knowingly collect directly from you, no security system is impenetrable. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any passively-collected personal information you choose to include in documents you store on our systems are maintained at levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information.

While no service is completely secure, Simon takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls, and information access authorization controls.

You may access your account information and our service only through the use of an individual user ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. In addition, always logout and close your browser when you finish your session. Please note that we will never ask you to disclose your password in an unsolicited phone call or email.

## Sharing of Information Collected
We may share your personal information we collect from you with:

* Companies that we plan to merge with or are acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Notice with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)
* Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process or requirement applicable to Simon; when we need to do so to comply with law; or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
* Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
